## Custom Logic

Custom logic refers to the implementation of specific business rules, workflows, or behaviors that go beyond the default functionality provided by Kubernetes. When extending the Kubernetes API, custom logic allows you to define how your custom resources or APIs should behave, process data, or interact with other systems.

In simpler terms, custom logic is the "brains" behind your custom resources or APIs. It defines what happens when:

- A custom resource is created, updated, or deleted.
- A specific API endpoint is called.
- Certain conditions or events occur in the cluster.

## Custom Logic in CRDs

When using CRDs, the cutom logic is typically implemented using controllers or operators. These are programs that watch for changes to custom resources and take action based on the desired state defined in those resources.

### Example: Custom Logic for a Book Resource

Suppose you have a custom resource Book (as defined earlier). You might want to implement custom logic that:

- Automatically generates a unique library ID for each book when it is created.
- Sends a notification to a librarian when a new book is added.
- Validates that the ISBN number is in the correct format.

To implement this, you would write a controller or operator that:

1. Watches for changes to Book resources.
2. Executes the custom logic (e.g., generating an ID, sending notifications, validating data).

## Custom Logic in the Aggregation Layer
When using the Aggregation Layer, custom logic is implemented directly in the custom API server. This allows you to define complex behaviors, integrate with external systems, or implement advanced workflows.

### Example: Custom Logic for a Car Resource
Suppose you have a custom API for managing Cars. You might want to implement custom logic that:

- Calculates the total cost of ownership for a car based on its make, model, and mileage.
- Integrates with an external car dealership system to fetch real-time pricing.
- Enforces business rules, such as preventing the creation of cars with invalid VIN numbers.

To implement this, you would:

1. Write a custom API server that exposes endpoints for managing Cars.
2. Implement the custom logic in the server (e.g., calculations, integrations, validations).
3. Register the custom API server with Kubernetes using an APIService resource.
