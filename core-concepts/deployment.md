The defination of deployment.yaml is similiar as replication.yaml

A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates for Pods.

It is designed to manage the deployment and scaling of applications.

### Purpose:

Deployments are used to define and manage the desired state of an application, including the number of replicas, update strategy, and rollback capabilities.

They provide a more user-friendly way to manage ReplicaSets and Pods.
